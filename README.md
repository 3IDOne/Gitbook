# Introduction to 3ID

### Welcome to 3ID!

Welcome to 3ID, a platform designed to drive the mass adoption of Web3 domains for every Web3 user and curator.

At 3ID, we envision a future where Web3 domains are accessible to everyone. By lowering the barriers to entry, we aim to foster a vibrant and inclusive ecosystem where anyone can benefit from the advantages of web3 identity and identifiers with ease.

### Technologies

We have integrated several novel technologies, such as **Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), Layer 2 solutions, Cloudflare workers and database and DNS manager, Vercel's serverless functions,** and many other ones that will me explained in detail on the Technologies section of documentations.&#x20;

* **Batch Subdomains for Products**: This service allows businesses and developers to create multiple subdomains in bulk, simplifying management and deployment.
* **Subdomain Marketplace**: Users can list and sell subdomains, creating new revenue streams and fostering a dynamic marketplace.
* **L3 App Chain**: Our forthcoming L3 app chain will enhance the trust-less flow of the subdomain resolving system, ensuring robust and secure domain resolution.
