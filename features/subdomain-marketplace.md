# Subdomain Marketplace

The subdomain marketplace is an upcoming feature of 3ID, designed to create a dynamic platform where Web3 users can list and monetize their ENS subdomains. This marketplace will support both DNS-based domains that have turned into ENS (e.g., `.com`) and the ENS-based subdomains (`.eth`)

### **Marketplace Overview**

1. **Listing Subdomains**:
   * Users can list their ENS subdomains on the marketplace. These subdomains can be either DNS-based (e.g., `example.com`) or ENS-based (e.g., `example.eth`).
   * The listing process involves providing details about the domain and signing a transaction.
2. **Setting Price**:
   * Domain owners can set a price for their subdomains. This price will determine the cost for other users to mint subdomains under the listed domain.
3. **Minting Subdomains**:
   * Users interested in acquiring a subdomain can browse the marketplace, select a domain, and mint subdomains based on the listed price.

### **Benefits and Future Developments**

* **Monetization for Domain Owners**:
  * The marketplace provides an opportunity for domain owners to monetize their assets by selling subdomains.
  * Owners can generate revenue by setting competitive prices and attracting buyers.
* **Diverse Domain Options**:
  * Users have access to a wide range of domain extensions, catering to different preferences and requirements.
  * This variety enhances the utility and appeal of the marketplace.
* **User-Friendly Interface**:
  * The marketplace will feature an intuitive interface, making it easy for users to list, browse, and mint subdomains.
  * Enhanced search and filtering options will improve the user experience.
* **Future Enhancements**:
  * As the marketplace evolves, additional features will be introduced, such as auction mechanisms, premium listings, and advanced analytics.
  * Continuous development will ensure the platform remains at the cutting edge of Web3 domain management.
